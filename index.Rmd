### About me

My name is Sharon Kulali and I am a first-year doctoral student at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health studying Environmental Health Sciences. I recently graduated from Purdue University where I studied Biochemistry & Public Health with a minor in Global Studies. During my time at Purdue, I worked on various research projects where I was introduced to the field of environmental health. My current research interests include examining the effects of environmental exposures on vulnerable and minority populations specifically regarding maternal and child health.
